  The type of item that a thread is associated with.

  Used in conjunction with contextId to find the item with which a thread
  is associated, and then to determine whether the authenticated user has
  permission to perform the requested action.

  The following contexts are currently supported:
  * `comms` (the internal name for [news](/#tag/news))
  * `evidence` (the internal name for learning moments: not yet documented)

  It is intended that discussion threads will be introduced to more contexts.
required:    true
schema:
  type: string
  enum: [comms, evidence]
