      A JSON Web Token (JWT) which authenticates the bearer as a particular
      user, and allows the bearer to perform API calls within the context of
      that user.

      This token is passed to the Schoolbox API according to the "BearerAuth"
      security scheme (i.e. in a HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer $token`).
