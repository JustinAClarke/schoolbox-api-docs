title: Form datetime
description: |
  A datetime as entered via a standard Schoolbox datetime form input.

  The format is dependent on the Schoolbox instance's "Numerical Date Format"
  and "Time Format" settings: ideally, this would just be a "datetime" format
  but the datetime input was developed before JSON was used for request bodies.
type: string
example: 22/06/2021 11:28am
