  summary: Get an authentication token
  description: |
    Retrieve an authentication token for the user

    This endpoint is intended so that in-browser API calls performed within
    a Schoolbox instance may be performed in a manner more in common with
    calls to a remote API.

    This endpoint only makes sense for users authenticated with the "session"
    security scheme, as it returns a token which is used by the "bearerAuth"
    scheme.
  security:
    - session: []
  responses:
    '200':
